## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r}
library(dplyr)
##groups the data by date
data <- group_by(data, date)

##calculate total number of steps per day
stepsperday <- summarize(data, sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
stepsperday

##assigns a convenient column name to total number of steps 
colnames(stepsperday)[2] <- "steps"

## creates an hitstogram of total number of steps per day
hist(stepsperday$steps)

##mean total number of steps taken per day
mean(stepsperday$steps)

## median of the total number of steps taken per day
median(stepsperday$steps)
```
